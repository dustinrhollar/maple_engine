This documents is the documentation for authoring shader layout configuation files. The config file format is currently split into 5 sections:
1. Header Block
-- Name: "Header"
2. Push Constant Block
-- Name: "Push Constants"
3. Set = 0, Global Layout
-- Name: "Global"
4. Set = 1, Object Layout
-- Name: "Object"
5. Set = 2, Material Layout
-- Name: "Material"

There are two into -> type conversions an author needs to be aware of.
1. Vulkan Descriptor Type

Vulkan Type                               | Integer Value
------------------------------------------|-----------------
VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER         | 0
VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_DYNAMIC | 1
VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER | 2

2. Shader Stages

Shader Stage                 | Integer Value
-----------------------------|----------------
Shader_Vertex                | 0
Shader_Fragment              | 1
Shader_Geometry              | 2
Shader_TesselationControl    | 3
Shader_TesselationEvaluation | 4
Shader_Compute               | 5


****************
* Header Block *
****************

The Header blocks contains the following information:
1.   Name of the layout type. This can be set in the corresponding *.mat file
2-7. Name of each shader stage as follows:
-- Vertex
-- Fragment
-- Geometry
-- Tesselation Control
-- Tesselation Evalaluation
-- Compute

     For standard pipelines, only Vertex and Fragment shaders are required. For compute pipelines, only the Computer shader is required.


***********************
* Push Constant Block *
***********************

The push constant information is spread across several arrays. Make sure that the push constant data aligns with the correct index across each array.

1. Count (i32): Number of push constant blocks in the pipeline. There can only be one per stage and sum of the size of all blocks must be no greater than 128 bytes.
2. Stage (i32, array): stage for the push constant block
3. Offset (i32, array): offset into the push constant block.
4. Size (i32, array): size of the block

***********************************
* Global, Material, Object Blocks *
***********************************

The current renderer attempts to bind descriptors at set intervals based on their update frequency. There are 3 Bind points: Global (set = 0), Per-Object (set = 1), and Per-Material (set = 2). The following data describes the binding information for the descriptor layout. The binding information is spread across several arrays, so make sure that the push constant data aligns with the correct index in each array.

1. Count (i32): Number of bindings for this descriptor layout
4. Binding (i32, array): binding for each info
3. Type (i32, array): type of binding (i.e. Uniform or Combined Sampler)
2. Stage (i32, array): stage for the binding
